            NEC is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community
            building. NEC token is our first token and allows users to hold
            Billions or even Trillions of them. Nicknamed the NECCOIN KILLER,
            this ERC-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still
            outpace NECcoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking).
            Popular worldwide, and already up thousands of percent, NEC token
            ($NEC) is the first cryptocurrency token to be listed and
            incentivized on NECSwap, our decentralized exchange. <br />We locked
            the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys! The
            remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first
            project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open
            market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't
            own team tokens they can dump on the community.

            It was originally set to be a rebase token pegged to the price of
            Dogecoin. Now, it has been unleashed and will not rebase. With a
            total circulation of ONLY 100k tokens, it has the opposite appeal to
            Shib (which has a much larger supply). The second token incentivized
            on the swap offers special rewards for those who provide liquidity.

            Due to the unique attributes of real estate, real estate can be
            NFTized. Each real estate is divided into 10,000 equity shares, and
            the NFT can be sold, transferred, pledged, etc.

          <p class="title">Simple procedure</p>
          <p class="desc">
            When we buy real estate, we don’t need complicated procedures. We
            directly purchase the corresponding NFT tokens, which means buying
            real estate. The whole process is very simple.

            NFT the real estate, and then split it into multiple shares.
            Investors can buy a small portion of them, which can make the lowest
            tradable price of the real estate very small and the investment
            amount smaller

          <p class="title">Good liquidity</p>
          <p class="desc">
            Real estate demolition is NFT-based, and after it can be split, the
            amount of investment per share becomes smaller, so more people are
            willing to participate in the transaction, and liquidity becomes
            better

            breed to keep. For this reason, and admittedly very surprisingly,
            many Shibas actually need to be rescued worldwide. For this reason,
            we launched a community effort utilizing the built in Amazon Smile
            feature to donate for this cause. This no cost method allows any NEC
            Inu member to help Rescue Shiba Inus by simply using
            smile.amazon.com when they place orders and put their preferred
            non-profit organization to Shiba Inu Rescue Association a 501(c)3. A
            percentage of your purchases go to support automatically. No cost to
            you! Our power is in community and as a community we can help Rescue
